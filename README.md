# The hand-written UML class diagram data set
The hand-written class diagram data set comes from Song Yang, who is a master's student in computer science.

Inspirations include the [yuml](https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/samples) examples page.

The train-test-validation split is 60-20-20.

To visualize the `.yuml` files, you need the yuml command-line tool on [GitHub](https://github.com/wandernauta/yuml).

The data comes in pairs: `.txt` in English and class diagrams in yuml in `.yuml`.
